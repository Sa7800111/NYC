NYC Taxi (2019) â€” Chunked ML Pipeline with Airflow (MWAA)

This project processes ~10.9 million NYC taxi rows (2019), converts features to fully numeric, trains a machine-learning model on the first chunk locally, and uses Airflow (AWS MWAA) to automatically train on the remaining chunks. Outputs (metrics + models) land in Amazon S3.
